# Transliteration
A Transformer model for Meitei Mayek transliteration.


# Note
Here, the term referring to is [Transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration) not to be confused with [Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation).

Definition by Google :
> Transliteration refers to the method of mapping from one system of writing to another based on phonetic similarity. 

And we all know what Translation means.   

**One thought to keep in mind.**   
*Throughout this project Translation and Transliteration will be used interchangeably. And both will be referred to Transliteration.*


# Model
The model used here is a [Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) implemented using Tensorflow.   

I wanted to try out if the model can do Zero Shot translation by following [Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04558). Not so successful for now.
